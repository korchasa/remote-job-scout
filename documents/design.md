**State**: React Query, custom hooks, localStorage persistence
**Features**: âœ… Multi-stage search UI, progress dashboard with ETA calculation, filtering stats, themes, responsive, real-time polling, session snapshots/persistence, favorites system, **client-side job actions with reactive filtering**

### Backend

**Tech**: Express.js REST API, modular middleware, Zod validation
**Arch**: Service-oriented, separation of concerns, type-safe schemas
**Storage**: âœ… YAML serialization, filesystem session persistence, localStorage client settings
**Services**: âœ… 6 business logic + 4 scrapers, parallel processing, token/cost tracking
**Middleware**: âœ… CORS, logging, security, error handling
**API**: âœ… HTTP polling, pause/resume, Zod schema validation with standardized error responses (FR-12), multi-stage search endpoints with ETA data, session snapshots
**Client Integration**: âœ… Privacy-focused client-side job actions (hide/block) with reactive filtering

### Shared

**Schemas**: Type-safe TypeScript
**Comm**: REST API, HTTP polling
**Validation**: Zod schemas with comprehensive input validation + standardized error responses (FR-12)

#### FR-12 Input Validation Implementation

**Comprehensive API Input Validation with Zod**

- **Validation Schemas**: Complete Zod schemas for all API endpoints (search requests, job updates, query parameters)
- **Standardized Error Responses**: HTTP 400 with `{code: "VALIDATION_ERROR", message, details: [...]}` format
- **Middleware Integration**: Express middleware for automatic validation and error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with inferred types from Zod schemas
- **Coverage**: All server endpoints validated (jobs, search, multi-stage, session operations)

## Data Architecture

### Entity Model

**âœ… Vacancy**: Job data with JSON metadata, enrichment tracking, LLM analysis
**âœ… Settings**: User config with language/country filters, blacklist/whitelist
**âœ… Progress**: Real-time tracking, 6 states (pending, running, completed, failed, paused, skipped)
**âœ… HiddenJob**: Client-side job hiding with metadata (reason, timestamp, source)
**âœ… BlockedCompany**: Client-side company blocking with metadata (reason, job count, timestamp)

### Storage Strategy

**âœ… Client**: localStorage (privacy-focused, user settings/config persistence, favorites storage, **client-side job actions**, session metadata)
**âœ… Server**: YAML serialization, filesystem session snapshots, session recovery
**âœ… Format**: YAML for jobs, JSON for API/snapshots, fixtures for testing
**âœ… Progress**: Real-time tracking, session persistence, pause/resume support
**âœ… Client Actions**: Isolated localStorage for hidden jobs + blocked companies with reactive filtering

## Algorithm Design

### Search Pipeline

1. **âœ… Collect**: Parallel scraping, concurrency control, retry/backoff âœ… IMPLEMENTED
2. **âœ… Filter**: Server-side criteria validation + client-side privacy filtering âœ… IMPLEMENTED (FR-4 + FR-11 COMPLETED)
3. **âœ… Enrich**: OpenAI LLM processing, token/cost accounting âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### Key Algorithms

**âœ… ETA**: `(total - processed) / speed Ã— 60` - Real-time calculation with exponential smoothing (Î±=0.2) + confidence indicators
**âœ… Retry**: Exponential backoff `delay = base Ã— 2^(attempt - 1)` - 4 sources
**âœ… Concurrency**: Max sources/positions, queue management - Parallel processing
**âœ… Progress**: Real-time % updates, ETA calculation with confidence, pause/resume - HTTP polling
**âœ… Cost**: Token usage Ã— model rate per vacancy - OpenAI integration
**âœ… Client Filtering**: Privacy-focused job hiding/blocking with reactive UI updates - localStorage persistence
**âœ… Company Matching**: Case-insensitive company blocking with automatic job filtering

### Rules

- Blacklist filtering priority
- User settings override auto rules
- **Client actions take precedence**: Hidden jobs + blocked companies override server-side results
- **Privacy by design**: Client-side actions never leave browser
- Operations logged for audit
- API key client-side only
