# FR-8 Implementation Progress: Session Snapshots

## ✅ COMPLETED: Session Snapshots (FR-8)

### Completed Tasks:

1. ✅ **Analyzed FR-8 Requirements** - Server-side session persistence and restoration with client-side localStorage
2. ✅ **Extended Data Schema** - Added SessionSnapshot and ClientSessionInfo interfaces to shared schema
3. ✅ **Created SessionSnapshotService** - Complete session snapshot management with filesystem persistence
4. ✅ **Enhanced MultiStageSearchOrchestrator** - Integrated snapshot saving/loading at all processing stages
5. ✅ **Created useSessions Hook** - Custom React hook with localStorage persistence and server synchronization
6. ✅ **Enhanced MainDashboard** - Added session status display and session management UI
7. ✅ **Enhanced ProgressDashboard** - Added pause/resume controls and session-aware state management
8. ✅ **Updated Server Startup** - Automatic session restoration from filesystem snapshots on server restart
9. ✅ **Written Comprehensive Tests** - TDD approach with 15+ test cases covering all session functionality
10. ✅ **Updated Documentation** - Marked FR-8 as completed in requirements and design documents

### Key Components Created/Enhanced:

- **SessionSnapshotService**: Complete session persistence with JSON filesystem storage
- **useSessions Hook**: Client-side session management with localStorage and server sync
- **MultiStageSearchOrchestrator**: Enhanced with snapshot save/load at all stages
- **MainDashboard**: Enhanced with session status indicators and controls
- **ProgressDashboard**: Enhanced with pause/resume functionality
- **Server Startup**: Automatic session restoration on restart
- **Schema Extensions**: Added SessionSnapshot and ClientSessionInfo types

### Technical Implementation Details:

- **Filesystem Persistence**: Sessions saved as JSON files in `data/sessions/<sessionId>.json`
- **localStorage Persistence**: Client sessions stored locally with expiration and cleanup
- **Server Synchronization**: Client hooks sync with server session state
- **Stage-aware Resume**: Sessions resume from correct processing stage without duplication
- **Automatic Restoration**: Server restores active sessions on startup
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time session status (running, paused, completed, stopped)
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling for file operations and state corruption

### Acceptance Criteria Met:

- ✅ Session snapshots saved in `data/sessions/<sessionId>.json` during processing
- ✅ Client stores sessions in localStorage and restores on launch
- ✅ Server restores sessions on startup (completed for read-only, active for resumption)
- ✅ Resume continues from correct stage boundaries without duplicate processing
- ✅ UI shows session status (running, paused, stopped, completed, error)
- ✅ Pause/resume controls work correctly with proper state management
- ✅ Session restoration handles corrupted data gracefully
- ✅ Filesystem operations are robust with proper error handling

### Build & Test Status:

- ✅ All builds successful
- ✅ All linting passed
- ✅ All tests passing (90+ tests passed, including 15+ new session tests)
- ✅ Code formatting applied
- ✅ No TODOs, FIXMEs, or debug prints found
- ✅ `./run check` completed successfully

### Security & Performance:

- Filesystem storage with proper permissions and error handling
- Client-side localStorage with automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- Efficient JSON serialization/deserialization
- Minimal performance impact with optimized file operations
- Secure implementation following existing codebase patterns

**FR-8 Session Snapshots feature is now fully implemented and ready for production use.**
