# FR-13 Implementation Progress

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS 🚧

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Read and analyze FR-13 requirements
2. ✅ Create structured logging schema with session IDs, timestamps, stage transitions
3. ✅ Implement masking for confidential data (API keys, sensitive info)
4. ✅ Write comprehensive tests for logging functionality and secret masking
5. ✅ Add structured logging for user actions (search start, pause/resume, job actions)
6. ✅ Add logging for stage transitions with retry counts and error descriptions
7. ✅ Add logging for scraper operations (requests, retries, failures)
8. ✅ Configure console output for development and file output for Docker
9. 🔄 Update whiteboard.md with implementation progress
10. ⏳ Run `./run check` and fix all issues
11. ⏳ Add/Update comments on file, function and code levels
12. ⏳ Update SRS/SDS documentation with FR-13 completion

## Logging Components Implemented

- ✅ Structured logging service with Winston integration
- ✅ Sensitive data masking (API keys, tokens, passwords, auth data)
- ✅ User action logging (search start/stop/pause/resume, job actions)
- ✅ Stage transition logging (pending → running → completed/failed)
- ✅ Scraper operation logging (requests, responses, successes, failures)
- ✅ HTTP request/response logging via enhanced middleware
- ✅ Development console output with colors
- ✅ Production file output for Docker environments

## Acceptance Criteria Progress

- ✅ Structured logs with timestamps, session IDs, stage names: Implemented
- ✅ User actions logging: Implemented
- ✅ Stage transitions with retry counts: Implemented
- ✅ Error descriptions and retry information: Implemented
- ✅ Sensitive data masking (API keys never logged): Implemented
- ✅ Development console output: Implemented
- ✅ Production file logging for Docker: Implemented

## Next Steps

- Run comprehensive checks and fix any issues
- Add detailed code comments and documentation
- Update SRS/SDS with FR-13 completion status
