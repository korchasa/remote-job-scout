## Quick Start

```bash
# Using dev container (recommended)
# Open in VS Code with Dev Containers extension
# Container will auto-install dependencies and run checks

# Local development
npm install
./run dev

# Production build
./run build
./run start

# Run tests
./run test

# Code quality checks
./run check
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - React application
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/jobs` - Get all jobs
- `GET /api/jobs/:id` - Get job by ID
- `POST /api/search` - Start job search
- `GET /api/progress/:sessionId` - Search progress

## Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t remote-job-scout .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 remote-job-scout
```
