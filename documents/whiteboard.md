   - localStorage save/restore tests
   - Settings validation tests
   - Search config transmission tests

3. **Language Requirements Processing:**
   - Correct language transmission from UI to API
   - Language settings validation

4. **Integration Tests:**
   - Full cycle verification: config → save → restore → server transmission

### Progress Summary:

3. **Test Creation:**
   - Basic SearchConfigPanel test created
   - localStorage integration verified
   - UI component mocks configured

### Test Results:

- ✅ 3 tests passing (including new test)
- ⚠️ Some component tests fail due to incomplete rendering in test environment
- 🔧 Basic testing infrastructure configured and operational
